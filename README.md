# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to build a website that compiles UFO sightings and let useres filter through them based on different criteria.

## Results
Users can now filter through different criteria and search for specific incidents by date, country, state, city, and/or shape of the reported UFO sighting. This will allow users to narrow down their search (ie.search for one specific incident) or keep it broad (ie. search for all incidents in a state/country). The website was built with html and Java as well as Bootstrap. 

## Summary
One drawback of our website is that there is limited data to filter through. It is likely that we are missing a lot of reported UFO sightings which may not provide users with what they're looking for. One reccomendation for this website would be to return state results if the user types in the full state name. As of right now, users can only search by the state abbreviations. Another reccomendation would be to remove the shape filter. It is unlikely that users will be able to utilize this effectively as there are many different ways for people to describe things.
